      <h1>About This Tool</h1>
      <p>This page was created as a simple way to visualize the difference in common frame rates in video, film, games, and other visual content with motion. Hover over a track to see the slider move at the listed frame rate.</p>
      <p class="note">This test works best in version 26 or newer of the desktop version of <a href="http://is.gd/C4r0m">Google Chrome</a>. Other browsers have trouble performing the animations smoothly. This test will not work on touch devices. Performance is dependent on many factors. If you're having trouble, please see <a href="about.html#performance">these tips for improving performance</a>.</p>
